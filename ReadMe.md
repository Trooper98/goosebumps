Rain? Wind? Temperature? You can bet that Goosebumps will have your back.

1. ```notCold == green ``` __&&__ ```veryCold == red``` 
2. ___```rain == blue Multi-Led```___ Can display, in binary terms, whether its going to rain in the next 5 hours 
3. ___```windy == white Multi-Led```___ Can display, in binary terms, whether its gonna be windy in the next 5 hours 
4. Fetches data hourly... with a rainbow show

## Architecture
### Software
The project has a top down structure given the constraints that were faced when importing components in python.
Components include:
- [led.py](./src/components/led.py) that works with the led bulbs
    >within ```led.py```, there are two classes that handle single color and multi-colored leds
- [weather_api.py](./src/components/weather_api.py) that works as a interface for the [Darksky](https://darksky.net/poweredby/) __api__.
    >initially, ```weather_api.py``` held two different apis, but now it mostly handles the darksky api since its the most accurate weather api I have used so far

(_if anyone whiches to do so [im so bored please do so]_)

### Hardware
1. __default pins__
- 3.3.v
- GND

2. __multi-color Led pins__
- red = GPIO 17 [pin 11]
- green = GPIO 27 [pin 13]
- blue = GPIO 22 [pin 15]

3. __LEDS__
- red LED = GPIO 13 [pin 33]
- green LED = GPIO 6 [pin 31]

4. __buttons__
- _lButton_ = GPIO 23 [pin 16]
- _rButton_ = GPIO 24 [pin 18]

6. __resistors__
_one for each __led__ or __button___
